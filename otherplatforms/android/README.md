** Android Specific Readme **

This src files substitute the ones place on the main src because those are desktop specific (related with file loading because they differ a lot on android).
This files depends on SDL 2.0, so in order to compile, you'll have to set up SDL2.0 too.
If one want to discard SDL, only have to adapt those files, and create the specific window interface like the ones used in examples/WindowManagers.
